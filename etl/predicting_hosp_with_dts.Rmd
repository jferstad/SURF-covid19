# Predicting Future Hospitalizations with Empirical Doubling Times

Idea: Predict future hospitalizations in a county with a few different methods:
* Exponential extrapolation from current hospitalizations with county empirical case DT
* Exponential extrapolation from current hospitalizations with state empirical hospitalization DT
* Exponential extrapolation from current hospitalizations with adjusted case DTs (with daily state hosp / state cases to account for test coverage growing)
* Some more fancy model. IHME ?


### Compare empirical hospitalization DTS, case DTs, and adjusted case DTs (with daily state hosp / state cases)

```{r}
emp_hosp_dts = fread('data/hosp/empirical_dts.csv')
```
